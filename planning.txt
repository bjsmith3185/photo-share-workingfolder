TODO


*** Image box
    - work on image box size so it doesnt change when notes are added
    - update or remove rotate button.

*** if a picture is deleted from the app
    --- a function needs to check each users favorties [] and remove that _id reference to avoid errors when the user tries to view favorites.
    - may be able to do this by comparing _id's and if the users fav does not match a pic in the picture collection that entry is skipped.

*** maybe use images for some of the links
        - for remove pictures, a single image or three images..

*** add modal to confirm delete all pictures 

*** add modal to delete user
        *** add a setTimeout to the delete user tab under admin.

*** add a forgot password function.
    - add a function to allow the user to answer a security question the first time they log in.
    - add a function to randomly select a security question to display and answer.






- modify the nav bar to include
    * top nav
    * signed in as...
    * div to show the screen the user is currently on
